# Evolving deep neural network agents using Genetic Algorithms

Implementing Deep Neuroevolution in PyTorch to evolve an agent for CartPole [code + tutorial]. This code accompanies my tutorial on [deep neuroevolution](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-without-gradients-evolving-agents-using-genetic-algorithms-8685817d84f).

The code supports neuroevolution of any PyTorch model (with linear or conv layers).
